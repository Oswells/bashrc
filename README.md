# Make Shell Great Again!
## How to make it work
Download the file ".myshell" to your linux host. 
Then execute the following commands in your terminal:
```shell
echo source .myshell >> .bashrc && source .bashrc
```
Each time you change the file ".myshell", you should run ```source .bashrc``` in your terminal.
